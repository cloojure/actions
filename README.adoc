= Clojure Template Project

A simple template for Clojure projects

== Overview

This Clojure project shows my favorite layout of for both source & test files
(sample Java source is included as well).  The project is also set-up to use the Tupelo Clojure
library and the Lein Test-Refresh plugin.

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

```pre
> lein clean ; lein test
```

with result:

```pre
lein test _bootstrap
-------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.1    Java 13
-------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World!\n"

Ran 4 tests containing 6 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

== Running Unit Tests with `lein test-refresh`

```pre
> lein test-refresh
```

with result:

```pre
Testing _bootstrap
-------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.1    Java 13
-------------------------------

Testing tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World!\n"

Ran 4 tests containing 6 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

Passed all tests
Finished at 07:56:48.252 (run time: 6.709s)
...
```

in this instance, the test output pauses after printint the elapsed time, and waits to re-run
upon any file change. For example, maks a simple change in the namespace `demo.core` and see
the tests re-run:

```pre
<snip>
Testing tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World! Again!\n"
<snip>
Finished at 07:59:53.863 (run time: 0.034s)
```

Note that the tests were all re-run in only 34 milliseconds (nearly instantaneous), since the JVM was already
started and all the Clojure & library code doesn't need to be re-compiled.

=== Using "Focus" Mode

Change one of the `dotest` forms in `tst.demo.core` to `dotest-focus`.  If there is at least one `dotest-focus` present
in the project, then ***only*** the "focus" tests will be run.  This is helpful when you want to
temporarily focus on a specific feature, without the distraction of all the other tests runnning.

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.

== Plumatic Schema

The function `demo.core/add2` shows the usage of https://github.com/plumatic/schema[Plumatic Schema] to document
function argument types and return value type.  This is a lifesaver!
